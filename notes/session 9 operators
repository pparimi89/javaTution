Arithematic operators:
    If we want to perform arithematic operations we use Arithematic operators
    +, -, /, %, *.

    % - THis will have value from remainder
    / - This will have value from quotient.
Ex: 70/20 - will give result as 3
Ex: 70%20 - will give result as 10

Unary Operator: These need only one operand.
  + - indicates positive value
  -  -this indicates negitive value
  ++ - tHis increments a value by 1
  -- - this decrements a value by 1

Assignment operator:
    variable = value;
    int i = (10/5);

    += -
    -=
    *=
    /=
    %=
-----------------------------

Assignment:
    write a class and Perform +, -, * operations
    Write a class a do increment and decrement operation
    Write assignment operator for *=, /+, %=

Relational OPerator:
   ==, <, >, <=, >=, != - All these will come under relational operator.
   The result of relational operator is always boolean (i.e true or false)

Logical operator:
   -> We have two logical operators, they are logical AND( && ) and Logical OR ( || )
    l1, l2, l3 -> serial

          logical AND
          true  true - true
          true  false - false
          false true  - false
          false false - false

          logical OR
          true  true -  true
          true  false - true
          false true  - true
          false false - false

Ternary operator.
      ?:
     here based on the condition, we can goto corresponding action that should be executed .
     the syntax will be as follow:
       Condition ? action to be performed if true : action to be performed if false

Assessment:
   -> Write program with <, <= and >
   -> Create own program using relational operator.
   -> Create own program using Logical & Ternary operator.
