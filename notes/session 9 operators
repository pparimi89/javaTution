Arithematic operators:
    If we want to perform arithematic operations we use Arithematic operators
    +, -, /, %, *.

    % - THis will have value from remainder
    / - This will have value from quotient.
Ex: 70/20 - will give result as 3
Ex: 70%20 - will give result as 10

Unary Operator: These need only one operand.
  + - indicates positive value
  -  -this indicates negitive value
  ++ - tHis increments a value by 1
  -- - this decrements a value by 1
Assignment operator:
    variable = value;
    int i = (10/5);

    += -
    -=
    *=
    /=
    %=
-----------------------------

Assignment:
    write a class and Perform +, -, * operations
    Write a class a do increment and decrement operation
    Write assignment operator for *=, /+, %=
