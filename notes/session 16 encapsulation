Encapsulation:
  ->  It is mechanism that binds code and data it manipulates into a single unit.
  -> The variable or data of class is hidden from other class (the data is hidden by giving private access to variables) and can be
  accessed only through member functions(nothing but functions)

Advatages of encapsulation:
    Data Hiding: The variables are hidden from other class, and can be access using memeber functions. You will control over the data.
    (you can provide read/write access based on need for the variables)
    Increased Flexibility:
       if you want some varaiables to have only read then you give getter alone, if you want some varaiables to have only write
       then you give setters alone, if you need both read write, we give getters/setter.
