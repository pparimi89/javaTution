Control statements:
    if we want to execute a piece of code based on some condition, we use control statements to handle them.

-> conditional If statements
-> conditional switch statement
-> while and do while loops
-> for loop
-> continue statement
-> break statement

-> conditional If statements:

 Simple If statement:
       if(condition){
         //statements that should be executed when the condition becomes true.
       }
 if else statement:
        If the condition is true it will have a block of statements to execute, if false it will have another block of statements to
        execute.
      if(condition){
         //statements that should be executed when the condition becomes true.
      }else{
           //statements that should be executed when the condition becomes false.
      }

if else ladder:
    it will have multiple conditional statements, if a condition fails it will enter into else if, if all the if and else if
    fails it will execte else block and exits.
   -> Only one block of statements will be executed.
    if(condition1){
       //statements that should be executed when the condition1 becomes true.
    }else if(condition2){
           //statements that should be executed when the condition2 becomes true.
    }else if(condition3){
       //statements that should be executed when the condition3 becomes true.
    }
    .
    .
    .
    else{
       //statements that should be executed when all the above condition becomes false.
    }

-----------------------------

Conditional switch statements:
    Here you will have an expression, based on the value of expression the control will be given to different part of the code

    switch(expression)
    {
      case val1:
       //statements to execute
       //break
      case val2:
       //statements to execute
       //break
      case val3:
       //statements to execute
       //break
       .
       .
       .
       .
       default:
         //statements
    }

------------------------------------------

Assessment:
   -> Find a even or odd number.
   -> You have 1 to 10 number, I should know the number name.
      input: 1
      o/p: you have pressed number 1
      input: 2
      o/p: you have pressed number 2
      .
      .
      input: 15
      o/p: you have pressed number greater than 10
    use else if ladder and switch statement
