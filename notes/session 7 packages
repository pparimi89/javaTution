Packages:
   - It is mechanism to group a set of classes, interfaces and subpackages together.

uses of packages:
    CSE
     Employee
     Students
     Department
     Canteen
    EEE
     Employee
     Students
     Depatment
     Canteen

     -> Prevent naming conflicts
     -> It makes names to have non redundant naming
     -> It helps in searching/locating a class or interface easily.

Naming Convention.
    www.fitbit.com  -> activities
    com.fitbit.activities.
    Java packaging name follows reverse domain naming structure.

    www.google.com -> gchat
    com.google.gchat.

    www.vitsolutions.com

    com.vitsolutions.javatution.

Writing a class inside a package:
   Two parts -
      1. Package keyword.
      2. you have to mention folder structure seperated by dot untill your class path.
      Lets take  you are creating a Employee class inside CSE package you have to mention like this.
      package com.vitsolutions.javatutions.cse;

Access classes inside a package.
    For accessing a class that is in different package in the current package, we have to use below structire.
    import com.vitsolutions.javatutions.examcell.ExamLocation;
    It has two parts:
      1. The first part is import keyword
      2. complete path to the class.

Types of packages:
                                   Packages
                                     |
   UserDefined packages                                  Inbuilt packages

inbuilt packages:
     Java.lang - It will have basic clases related to Output printing, Data types, Math operation
     java.io - Contains supporting classes for user input/outpout operations
     java.util - This will have structures related to datastructs, lists, maps


UserDefined packages:
    We already discuused the userdefined packages above.

Static imports:
   if we have any static methods or variables inside a class then we can access them directly using
   static import in another class of different package.
This will three parts:
    1. import
    2. static keyword
    3. complete path to the method name/complete path to the variable name
ex: I want to access a static method printExamLocation inside ExamCell then we have to use like this.
import static com.vitsolutions.javatutions.examcell.ExamLocation.printExamLocation;

ex: I want to access a static variable examCellName inside ExamCell class then we have to use like this.
import static com.vitsolutions.javatutions.examcell.ExamLocation.examCellName;
