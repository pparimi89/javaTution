Inheritance:
   - Here one class is allowed to inherit the properties(variables) and behaviours(methods) of another class
   - The main advantage of inheritance is reusability, we can reuse the fields and methods of parent class in child class


Terminology:
    Super/parent class: The class whose features are inherited
    Sub/child class: the class that inherit other class is known as subclass.
The subclass can add its ownfields and methods, in addition a subclass can override behaviour of super class.

We connect classes that are involved in inheritance relation using "extends" keyword.

EX:  father
  100kg gold
  100kg silver

  snores{
    I will snore
  }
  worksSmart
  thinkFast

  son extends father{
  100 diamonds;
  snores{
      I will not snore
    }
  runFast()
  swim()
  jump()
  }

Types of inheritance:
  -> Single Inheritance:
     The subclass will inherit features of one superclass.
         class A
           |
           |
         class B

  -> multilevel Inhertiance
       class A
         |
         |
     class B extends class A
         |
         |
     class C extends class B
        |
        |
     class D extends class C

  -> heirarchal inheritance: Here one class will serves as parent for multipile child classes.
             Father
               |
     --------------------------
     |       |          |
    Son1    Son2      Son3  ... Etc

  -> Multiple Inheritance:
       Multiple inheritance is not supported in java with concrete class, but we can do it using interfaces. The reason is ambiguity.
       With concrete class we have implementations, compiler dont know which implementation to be taken to child.
       with interfaces since there was no implementation compiler will be able to do multiple inheritance.
       class Father1       class Father2
            void think(){}       void think() {}
               |                   |
            -----------------------
                       |
                      Son

  -> Hybrid Inheritance:
      - It is a combination of two or more types of above inhertance types, hybrid ]inhertance also java not support.
                class A
                  |
      ------------------------------
      |                            |
    class B                     class C
      |                           |
     ------------------------------
               |
             class D
