Naming conventions
----------------------
There are three different things when you write class.
  - Class
  - method(functions/behaviours)
  - variable(properties)

Naming convention for class;
   -> employee checker ->  EmployeeChecker
   -> It should be noun.
   The starting letter of word should be capital letter
Naming convention for method:
    -> it should be verb.(some work it does)
    open mobile lock -> openMobileLock
Naming convention for variables:
   -> camel case format.
   price - variables also kind of nouns.
   name format - nameFormat

--------------------------------------
Methods/functions/behaviors
  - Different parts of a function.
we will have 6 parts in a function.
public void printEnginehoorsePower(){
}

1. access specifier
   - it can be public, private, protected, default
   public - This will be accesed in the entire application.
   private - The access will be only withing your class
   protected - The access will be in same package and if you want access in other packages we have to use inheritence.
   default: The access will be within same package.

2. return type.
     -> if we are returning any type then the return type also should be of same type.
     -> If we are not returing any type, it should be void.
     public Integer getNumberTen(){
        return 10;
     }

     public String getNumberTenName(){
        return "Ten";
     }

     //It dont have any outpout from this.
    public void printEnginehoorsePower() throws Exception{
    }

3. Name of the function/method/behavior
4. body of the method- {}
5. Parameters - The parameters are nothing but inputs to the function.
    public void printEnginehorsePower(Integer horsepower, String powerType, boolean isEngineWorking){
        System.out.println(horsepower);
    }
6. Exeptions:
     throws Exception - this part is place we declare exceptions.
    public void printEnginehoorsePower() throws Exception, IoException{
    }
