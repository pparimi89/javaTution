Constructors:
    Car car = new Car();
-- when we create a constructor instance variables will get initialized;
- For your class memory will be created and the reference will be assigned to the class reference.

Rules for wirting constructor:
    public Caluculator(){
     }
  - Your class name and constructor name should be same.
  - It wont have any return type.
  - It can have access modifiers like public, private, protected, default.
when a constructor is called ?
-------------------------------
      when ever we give the keyword "new" followed by constructor, our constructor will get invoked and object will get
      created in the memory.

Types of constructors:
-----------------------
   Default constructor:
      Whenever we create a class, a default constructor will be created by compiler if we dont give any constructor
      inside the class  -  Very very important statement.
   No-arg constructor:
       if we create constructor without arguments or parameter then it is No-arg constructor.
   Parameterized constructor:
       If we pass any parameters to a constructor, then it is parameterized constructor.

   To invoke a current class constructor inside another constructor we have to use this operator.
for EX: to invoke no arg constructor from a parameterized contructor then use "this()", it should be the first line of that constructor.


Assesment:
-------------------------------------------
1. create a class.
2. create four instance variables.
3. initilize those all instance variables, for three variables give some value, for 4th variable initilize that with the sum of
the three varialbles.
4. create 4 objects, and print values of those 4 instance variables default values.
