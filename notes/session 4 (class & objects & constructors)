Class:
   -> It is a blueprint of an object.
   -> it will have properties and behaviours.

properties - these are nothing but variables.
behaviours - these are nothing but methods.

--------------------------------

public class Book{

  String author;
  String description;
  Integer price;
  String manufacturingLocation;
  Integer numberofChapters;

  public void getReaderName(){
    System.out.println("Phani");
  }

  public void keepItInShelf(){
      System.out.println("I kept in shelf 10");
  }

  public static void main(String args[]){
    System.out.println("**Hello World**");
  }

}

------------------------------------
Class Dog{

  String colour;
  String breed;
  Integer height;
  Integer weight;

  public void bark(){
    System.out.println("bark");
  }

  public void eat(){
     System.out.println("bark");
  }

  public void sleep{
     System.out.println("bark");
  }

  public void printHowManyTimesMyDogBarken() {
          System.out.println("100");
  }
}

---------------------------------------

Object:
-----------
Object is instance of a class, (each object is created by taking the structure from the class)
lets take a building, you create buiding from its plan, similarly you create object from class.

Jumping into program:
Object creation will have two steps:
   Declaration:
   Dog pet -  This is declaration;
   Dog as type, and pet(variable name) as reference.

   Initialization or Instantiation:
  There is a key word "new", which is used to create object. it will allocate memory for your object.
  new Dog();

Dog pet = new Dog();  //This declaration creates object in memory

   - Car class -  engine, color, speed, power these are properties, methods in it are doBreaking, doAccelarate.
   - Employee class
