Variable:
     It will have three parts
     dataType : This was mandatory part, in the below the keyword "int" is datatype
     referenceName : This was the reference for the value that is stored in memory
     initilization : this is not mandatory, here we assign value to the variable, what happens here the 10 value will be stored in memory and the
     memory reference will be assigned to i.

int i = 10;

Types of variables:
    1. Local Variables
    2. instance variables
    3. static variables

Local variables:
     - the variables that are present inside a method are called local variables.
     - these variables are created when the method start executing and destroyed when the methods completes it execution.
     - initialization is mandatory.

Instance variables:
      - The variables that are declared outside of method they are called instance variables.
      - These are created when object of class is created and destroyed once object is destroyed.
      - initialization is not mandatory, it can take default values.
      - These are accessed by creating objects.

static variables:
     - These variables are called class level variables.
     - These are declared similar to instance variable, but the difference is they are declared using "static" keyword.
     - unlike instance variables we can have only one copy of this variable for class.
     - These are created at start of program and destroyed when program get closed.
     - Initialization is not mandatory, it can initialize to default values.

Assignment:
   - Write a program to count number of objects created for a class.

   create a class Student.
   Now if you create one object for this. I should get the value as 1.
   if i create 10 objcts then i should know i created 10 objects.
