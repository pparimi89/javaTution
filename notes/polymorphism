Polymorphism:
    -> The word polymorphism refers to poly means many morphism means forms.
    -> polymorphism allows us to perform single action in different ways.
In Java we will have two types of polymorphism.
     -> Compile time polymorphism
     -> Runtime polymorphism

    CompileTime polymorphism:
         -> It is also called static polymorphism
         -> You can achieve compile time polymorphism using method overloading.

            Method Overloading:
                     -> When there are multiple methods with same name but with different parameters, then these functions are overloaded.
                    it can be done in two different ways of having method parameters.
                      - Different types of arguments
                      - Different number of arguments.


    Runtime Polymorphism:
        -> It is also known as Dynamic method dispatch
        -> A function call to overriden method is resolved at runtime.
       This is achieved by using method overriding.

   Method Overriding.
      -> when a child class has a definition for one of the functions of the parent class. Then the function
      that is in child class is said to be overriden.
