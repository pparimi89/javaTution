Access Specifiers/ modifiers.

- We have four different access specifiers:
  public:
    - We can specify public access for a class, a method, instance variable and constructor.
    - If we keep public access specifier for a class, we can create object or access the class anywhere in the project.
    - If we keep public access specifier for a method, we can access it anywhere in the project using the object.
    - If we keep public access specifier for a instance variable, we can access it anywhere in the project using the object
    - If we keep public access specifier for a constructor, we can create object for that class anywhere in the project
  private:
    - We cant keep a class as private.
    - If we keep private access specifier for method, we can access it inside the class alone, you cant access it out of class.
    - If we keep private access specifier for a instance variable, we can access it inside the class alone, you cant access it outside.
    - If we keep private access specifier for a constructor, we cannot create object for that class.
  protected:
    inside the same package, and if we want to access out of package then we need to extend the class and then we can access the method.
    - We cant keep a class as protected.
    - If we keep protected access specifier for method, we can access it inside the classes that are in same package, You can access it outside
        of package by using extends keyword for the class.
    - If we keep protected access specifier for a instance variable,  we can access it inside the classes that are in same package, You can access it outside
        of package by using extends keyword for the class.
    - If we keep protected access specifier for a constructor, we can create object for that class in the classes that are in same package.You can access it outside
      of package by using extends keyword for the class.
