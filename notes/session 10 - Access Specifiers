Access Specifiers/ modifiers.

- We have four different access specifiers:
  public:
    - We can specify public access for a class, a method, instance variable and constructor.
    - If we keep public access specifier for a class, we can create object or access the class anywhere in the project.
    - If we keep public access specifier for a method, we can access it anywhere in the project using the object.
    - If we keep public access specifier for a variable, we can access it anywhere in the project using the object
    - If we keep public access specifier for a constructor, we can create object for that class anywhere in the project
  private:
  protected:
    inside the same package, and if we want to access out of package then we need to extend the class and then we can access the method.
  default:
