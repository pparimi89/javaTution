final Keyword:
        -> final keyword is applicable on variable, method, class.
    Variable:
          -> to create constant variables we used final
          -> once you initialize a variable which has final keyword we cannot modify it.

        Initializing a variable:
            -> one is normal way, we create variable and assign value to it.
            -> we create a final variable and initialize it in "instance initializer block"(constructor).
            -> it can be initialized inside a static block.

    Method:
        -> final keyword can be used with method.
        -> if we want to stop the overriding of method that is declared in parent class inside child class then we use
        final keyword for that method.
    Class:
       -> Final keyword can be used with class.
       -> When a final keyword is used with class, we cannot use the class as parent class in any other child classes i.e final with class stops inheritance.
